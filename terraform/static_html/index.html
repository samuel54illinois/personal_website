        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>About
            I am a sophomore undergraduate student at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
            I am currently a Mathematics major with concentration in Data Optimization and with a minor in Data Science. 
            I am excited to apply skills from my Stats, Math, and Data Science classes into the real world scenario to solve real-world problems.

            <h3>Project 1: Global Superstore Sales Analysis</h3>
            <p>This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the Global Superstore dataset to derive business insights. Using Tableau, I created eight interactive visualizations and a consolidated dashboard to explore sales, profit trends, shipping costs, and customer behaviors. The project demonstrates skills in data cleaning (Python), exploratory analysis (Jupyter), and data visualization (Tableau Public). 
                Key takeaways include identifying regional performance disparities, product category profitability, and customer segmentation for strategic business decisions.

            <h3>Project 2: Mall Customer Segmentation</h3>
            <p>Description:
                This project uses K-means clustering to segment mall customers based on their annual income and spending behavior. The analysis identifies four distinct customer groups, each with unique characteristics, to guide marketing strategies.
                
                New Highlights:
                Added actionable business recommendations for each customer segment based on insights from the clustering.
                Included visuals, such as the Elbow Method plot and customer segmentation scatterplot, for better data representation.
                
                Business Impact:
                Budget-friendly strategies for price-sensitive customers.
                Premium offerings and personalized experiences for high-value customers.
                Promotions and flexible payment options for high-spending customers.</p>
